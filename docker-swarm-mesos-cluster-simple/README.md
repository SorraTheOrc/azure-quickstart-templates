This is a sample template to create a Docker Swarm cluster on Azure. It uses Docker hub as a discovery service and requires token(cluster id) as a parameter. User needs to create a token id using command 'docker run swarm create' before the template deployment. The Swarm created is not secure, use this template to create a test swarm cluster but it is not recommended for the production.

Once your Swarm has been created you will have a resource group containing three VMs acting as nodes and a fourth whcih is your swarm master. To connect to this swarm with Docker you need to set your environment with:

export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=
export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://YOURDNSNAMEmmaster.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:2376"

Note this turns off TLS (i.e. it is insecure) - do not use in production. You need to replace 'YOURDNSNAME' with the DNS name you provide in the parameters.
